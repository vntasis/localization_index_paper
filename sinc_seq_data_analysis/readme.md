# Analysis of the pseudo-bulk data

The pseudo-bulk dataset is generated by merging single-cell RNAseq data
(SINC-seq). This code helps with estimating _beta_.

- [main.R](main.R) is the main script of the analysis.
- [preprocess.R](preprocess.R) is called by the main script and
  helps with the filtering and normalization of the data.
- [convert2json.R](convert2json.R) saves the fpkm expression values
  in a json format. This is the input for the
  [inference of _beta_](../beta_inference/) using Stan-NF.
- [save_estimations.R](save_estimations.R) reads the output of
  Stan-NF and saves the posterior estimates in a `.RData` file.
